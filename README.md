# mongo-todo-api

The Mongo Todo API accepts basic CRUD operations on a todo object.

The API expects and returns the following format of a todo:

```
{
  completed: boolean,
  text: string,
}
```

This service is primary built for experimentation with new front end frameworks while following a consistent DB pattern.
